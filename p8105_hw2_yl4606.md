# Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trash_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read and clean the 2017 and 2018 precipitation datasets.

``` r
precipitation_2017_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)

precipitation_2018_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Combine two precipitation datasets.

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows( precipitation_2017_df, precipitation_2018_df)
```

For Mr. Wheel Trsh data frame, there are 344 times of dumpster
obervation. Key variables include dumpster, month, year, date,
weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags,
sports\_balls, homes\_powered . For precipitation data frame, there are
24 times of obervation. Key variables include year, month, total . The
total precipitation for 2018 is 70.33. The median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.
